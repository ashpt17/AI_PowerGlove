Proposal: 

Description:
Functional requirements: must be wearable, able to tell shades of colors, needs to detect how close you are to desired fabric, 
Non-functional requirements: lightweight, user friendly, not too loud/ abrasive, comfortable to wear, relatively fashionable, should allow user to still feel material
Constraints: budget, time limit, programming ability(no AI), no ability to tell fabric
Sensors (inputs):
RGB sensor - detects the color of the clothing the user is trying to scan
Ultrasonic sensor - detects how close or far the product is from the clothing to know when the product should or should not actively running
Button - power button that runs the programs when pressed and then stops when pressed again
Outputs:
Vibrator motor - the purpose is to give the user a subtle buzz or vibration when the user is close enough to the clothing and the sensors are scanning
Speaker - will tell the user what color the clothing is with different phrases and say to the user the possible color matching options that go well together.
